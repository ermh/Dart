Belay in Dart
=============

Introduction
------------
This sample application demonstrates a web application written in Dart using
the BCAP protocol. It interacts with the rest of the Belay infrastructure and
other Belay based applications to demonstrate a flexible approach to cloud
authentication.

This Dart application demonstrates several things:
  * Client-side written in Dart
  * Server-side written in Dart with the fling server framework
  * Client/Server async communication in Dart
  * Interoperability with JavaScript libraries
  * Interoperability with other web pages written in JavaScript
  * A binding of the BCAP abstract API into Dart

Running
-------
1. You need the rest of the Belay infrastructure running on your machine:
  a. Install AppEngine SDK from: http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html
  b. Download the source from: http://code.google.com/p/google-belay/
  c. Follow the README in the Belay tree to start the servers

2. Make sure you've built the dart/client tree:
  cd dart/client
  ../tools/build.py --arch=dartc

3. Run the Buzzer application server:
  cd dart/samples/belay/buzzer
  ../../../client/out/Debug_dartc/fling/fling/fling BuzzerServer.dart

4. Open a browser and:
  a. Browse to http://localhost:9000/pick-station.html
  b. Click on "Launch my station"
     -- you now have the JavaScript Belay infrastructure up and running

5. In a new window:
  a. Browse to http://localhost:9014/index.html
     -- this browses to this Dart based Buzzer application
  b. Type in a title for a new blog and click submit
     -- you now have blog
  c. Type something into the text box and click Bzr
     -- you now have blogged
  d. close the window
  e. From the "Station" window, you'll see your new blog listed,
     click the "open" link on the right for it.
