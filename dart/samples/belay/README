Belay in Dart
=============

Introduction
------------
This sample application demonstrates a web application written in Dart using
the BCAP protocol. It interacts with the rest of the Belay infrastructure and
other Belay based applications to demonstrate a flexible approach to cloud
authentication.

This Dart application demonstrates several things:
  * Client-side written in Dart
  * Server-side written in Dart with the fling server framework
  * Client/Server async communication in Dart
  * Interoperability with JavaScript libraries
  * Interoperability with other web pages written in JavaScript
  * A binding of the BCAP abstract API into Dart

Running
-------
1. The Belay infrastructure requires AppEngine. Do one of the following:
  a. If you have AppEngine SDK installed already, either be sure
     dev_appserver.py is on your PATH, or note the location of it.
  b. Use the AppEngine SDK that is part of the dart tree. In particular,
     dev_appserver.py is located in {dart}/third_party/appengine-python/1.5.4/
  c. Install the AppEngine SDK from:
     http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

2. You need the rest of the Belay infrastructure running on your machine:
  a. Download the Belay source from: http://code.google.com/p/google-belay/
  b. Start the belay servers:
     cd {belay}
     ./run.sh {loc-of-dev_appserver.py} start

3. Run the Buzzer application server:
     cd {dart}/samples/belay/buzzer
     ./start-server
     -- this will build dartc and the fling web-server if needed, then start
     -- the Buzzer server. You know it is ready when it prints:
     Buzzer [INFO ] Started server at http://localhost:9014/

4. Open a browser and:
  a. Browse to http://localhost:9000/pick-station.html
  b. Click on "Launch my station"
     -- you now have the JavaScript Belay infrastructure up and running

5. In a new browser window:
  a. Browse to http://localhost:9014/index.html
     -- this browses to this Dart based Buzzer application
  b. Type in a title for a new blog and click submit
     -- you now have blog
  c. Type something into the text box and click Bzr
     -- you now have blogged
  d. close the window
  e. From the "Station" window, you'll see your new blog listed,
     click the "open" link on the right for it.
