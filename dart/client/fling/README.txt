Fling is a little dart runtime intended for 'banging' out web (client +
server) apps pretty quickly. Here is an example of how get started.

Starting in the fling root directory,

$ ant
# fling will be built into out/fling

$ cd out/fling/samples

$ ../fling lil_server.app
# Check out the code in samples/lil_server.dart
