'hi' is a simple 'hello world' Dart application that runs in the browser.

Building and running:

1. go to the top-level directory of the project:
  $ cd dart/

2. build the dartc compiler:
  $ ./tools/build.py --arch=ia32

3. run the htmlconverter tool, that converts the dart code to javascript:
  $ python ./client/tools/htmlconverter.py client/samples/hi/hi.html -o out/

4. open the generated file in a browser:
  $ google-chrome out/client/samples/hi/hi-js.html
