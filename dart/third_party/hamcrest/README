Description:
Provides a library of matcher objects (also known as constraints or
predicates) allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively, to be used in
other frameworks. Typical scenarios include testing frameworks, mocking
libraries and UI validation rules.

Google specific notes:
The original jars contained both source code and compiled classes.
These were split, following Google standard naming convention, like this:

    hamcrest-core-1.1.jar
    hamcrest-core-1.1-src.jar

When adding new versions of this library, please continue to follow this
practice, as it enables IDE integration to attach sources, and avoids warnings
from our build tools.
