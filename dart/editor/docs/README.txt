------------- Dependent Plugins -----------

Install the Chrome developer tools...
   Update Site: dart/trunk/dart/third_party/chromesdk/0.3.0
   You just need the ChromeDevTools SDK feature.

------------- Linked Resources ------------

Create a "Path Variable" in the "General > Workspace > Linked Resources" preference page
    called "DART_TRUNK" that points to the SVN dart/trunk/dart directory
    that you checked out as specified in the instructions above.

-------------Classpath Variables -----------

Create a "Classpath Variable" in "Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables" preference page
    called "DART_TRUNK" that points to the same directory as the "DART_TRUNK" path variable above

------------- Text Editors ----------------

Window->Preferences->General->Editors->Text Editors

---------- Save Actions -------------------

Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Save Actions

Enable "Perform the Selected Actions on Save"
Enable "Format Source Code" (format all lines)
Enable "Organize Imports"
Enable "Additional Actions"
Click "Configure", and make sure that all actions are disabled except:
- "Remove trailing white spaces on all lines"
- "Sort members excluding fields, enum constants, and initializers"
- "Convert control statement bodies to block"
- "Add missing '@Override' annotations"
- "Add missing '@Override' annotations to implementations of interface methods"

- "Remove unnecessary casts"

---------- Code style/formatting ----------

Window->Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter->Import...
  <DART_TRUNK>/eclipse/docs/dart-format.xml

----------- Import organization -----------

Window->Preferences->Java->Code Style->Organize Imports->Import...
  <DART_TRUNK>/eclipse/docs/dart.importorder

------------ Member sort order ------------

Window->Preferences->Java->Appearance->Members Sort Order
There is no import here, so make your settings match:
  settings/code-style/dart-sort-order.png

First, members should be sorted by category.
1) Types
2) Static Fields
3) Static Initializers
4) Static Methods
5) Fields
6) Initializers
7) Constructors
8) Methods

Second, members in the same category should be sorted by visibility.
1) Public
2) Protected
3) Default
4) Private

Third, within a category/visibility combination, members should be sorted
alphabetically.

------------ Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings ------------

Set to ignore:

- Potential programming problems > Serializable class w/o serialVersionUID
- Unnecessary Code > Parameter is never read

====================================
  Importing the Eclipse projects
====================================

File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace

Import the existing projects in <DART_TRUNK>/compiler/eclipse.workspace

Import the existing projects in <DART_TRUNK>/eclipse
  (including the "docs" project containing this README.txt file)

Import the project in <DART_TRUNK>/third_party/closure_compiler_src

====================================
  Building Closure
====================================

We now build the closure compiler from source. To do this, right click on closure-compiler/build.xml
and choose Run As > Ant Build (the default option, not the Ant Build... option). This will create
the closure-compiler/build/compiler.jar library, which will be picked up by the 
com.google.dart.compiler.js project.

Refresh the closure-compiler project for Eclipse to see the new files.

====================================
  Launching the Plugin
====================================

Once your projects have been imported, go to the Package Explorer and
right-click on the "com.google.dart.tools.ui" project. Go to "Run As", and select
"Eclipse Application". Another instance of Eclipse should launch, running the Dart
plugin!
